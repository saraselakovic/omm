## **Project parachutist-model**
The first part of the project is to set up mathematical model of a parachutist with a mass of 90kg, which jumps out of an airplane at a height H. The second part of the project is to write functions visine.h and grafik.h. Funciton visine.h calculates the smallest height h for opening parachute that guarantees a safe landing for given value H. Function grafik.h draws a graph of the dependence of speed on time for given value H.
