**Project parachutist-model**

A parachutist with a mass of 90 kg jumps out of an airplane at a height H. Air resistance is proportional to the square of the speed of movement. 
The limit speed of free fall of a parachutist without an open parachute is 50m/s, and with an open parachute 5m/s. The parachute opens instantly at a certain height h. 
The safe landing speed is 10m/s. 
Set up a mathematical model and, for various values of height H, calculate the smallest height h that guarantees a safe landing.
